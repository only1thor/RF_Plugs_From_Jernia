# RF_Plugs_From_Jernia
A repo to list on/off codes for the rf remote controlled plugges from the Norwegian Store Jernia.

Jernia is selling their rf pluggs for cheap, since they're going out of production. 
I wanted to document the codes here to make integration with Home Assistant easier. 

Check the other .md files for the codes, and i will at some point add a config for Home Assistant.
